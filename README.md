# LumenPNP Nema8 Z-Gantry Mod

## About

This repository contains a simple mod for the [LumenPNP](https://github.com/opulo-inc/lumenpnp), an open-source pick and place machine designed to aid in mid-scale manufacturing. This mod replaces the original Z-Gantry with one compatible with a Nema8 stepper motor.

The LumenPNP is designed to be low-cost enough that someone could buy or build one to support making production runs at home or as a small business. It runs using OpenPnP. More details about LumenPNP can be found on the [original repository](https://github.com/opulo-inc/lumenpnp).
